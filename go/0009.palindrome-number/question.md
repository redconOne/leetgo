# [9. Palindrome Number][link] (Easy)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a **palindrome**, and `false`
otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes
121-. Therefore it is
not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**

- `-2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
